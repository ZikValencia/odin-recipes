<p>This Instant Pot chicken and dumplings recipe provides the richness of a long-simmered </br>
   chicken stew without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise — using boneless </br>
   skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast — gave me the richness of flavor and ease </br>
   of preparation I was looking for. It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather </br>
   than an oven.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
    <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
    <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon thyme (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup frozen petite peas</li>
    <li>½ cup frozen cut green beans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dumplings:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Pour olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot) and select the Sauté function. <br/>
         and stir onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until vegetables are soft and onion has turned translucent, about <br/>
         5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add chicken broth, thighs, breasts, salt, thyme, marjoram, and black pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high <br/>
        pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure <br/>
        to build.
    </li>
    <li>
        While chicken is cooling, mash butter with flour in a small bowl to make a smooth paste; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make dumplings: Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry<br/>
        blender until mixture resembles the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.</li>
    <li>
        Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste broth and season with salt and pepper if needed. Add peas and green<br/>
        beans. Stir in flour-butter paste until incorporated. Select Sauté function and bring broth to a boil.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour buttermilk into dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls over the top of stew.
    </li>
    <li>
        Close the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until a skewer <br/>
        inserted into the center of a dumpling comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes.
